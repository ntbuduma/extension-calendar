# extension-calendar

We have a chrome extension, and following this https://pythonspot.com/en/create-a-chrome-plugin-with-python/ so then we can work in python cuz javascript is gross af.

For the actual calendar logic, we're probably gonna fork a lot of the code from the command line google calendar thing (cloned). Basically we need to make a google api app, get a secret key/app id and whatnot, and then use these to make requests. We can also figure out how we're parsing, but there are some things in the gcalclic.
